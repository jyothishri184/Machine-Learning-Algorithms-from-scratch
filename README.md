## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression:** Implementation of simple linear regression for predicting a continuous target variable.

2. **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification using logistic regression with gradient descent optimization.

3. **Polynomial Regression:** Model that can capture non-linear relationships between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning-Algorithms.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms
   ```

2. Explore the algorithms:

ðŸš€ Open and run Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm in the `notebooks` directory.

ðŸš€ View the Python scripts in the `src` directory for standalone implementations.

## Contribution Guidelines
