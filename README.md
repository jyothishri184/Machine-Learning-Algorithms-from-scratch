## Introduction
Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! Here, I've implemented fundamental machine learning algorithms without using external libraries, emphasizing clarity and education. Explore the code to gain insights into the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **L1,L2 Regularization:** 
   - L1 (Lasso) regularization adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function, promoting sparsity in the model by encouraging some coefficients to become exactly zero.
   - L2 (Ridge) regularization adds the squared values of the coefficients to the loss function, preventing large weights and mitigating multicollinearity by penalizing high magnitudes of all coefficients.

2. **Logistic Regression:** 
   - Binary classification using logistic regression with gradient descent optimization.

3. **Polynomial Regression:** 
   - Model that can capture non-linear relationships between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line.

4. **KMeans Clustering:**
   - An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.
